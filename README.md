# Weather-App

## What you will create

We have made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. We'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## Build And Run Instructions

Just download source code and unzip the downloaded folder and open project in Xcode.

## Using Terminal:

git clone https://github.com/mustafahussain388/New-Weather-App


## What we have Done

* Create a dark-mode enabled app. 
* Use of Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Use of Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Use of URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
